# Getting Started :spaghetti:

Simply navigate to ‘Get Started’ by either clicking the navigation link at the top or scrolling to the bottom of the page. There you will see a form to fill out. Fill in your name, upload a selfie, pick your food preference and a time, enter a zip code or city and wala~ The app will the populate the closest restaurants near you.

After selecting the restaurant you want, the app will then search our database for any other users near your location who picked the same restaurant and match you! You can then meet up at the restaurant at the designated time and hang out with your new foodtrovert buddy.

# Motivation :stew:

Foodtroverts is a platform built with the intention of bringing people together, everyone has to eat so why not add some company? Often times people associate food with dating - so we are here to get rid of that stigma. However - new friends, great experiences, networking, and maybe a new mate… it’s ALL welcomed here after a good meal!

What do you have to lose? Get started today!
